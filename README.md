# mindEase_v2: A Redo of mindEase

An improvement over MEv1, which used only a basic LLM call with a HTML front-end. 

# What's new ?

1. Multi-modelled approach for handling mental health
2. Seriousness has been increased exponentially due to gravity of the situation
3. Front-end being developed as well to go hand-in-hand with the backen
4. Deployable code, not just a working POC
